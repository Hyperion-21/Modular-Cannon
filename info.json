        "Adds the Modular Cannon, a weapon that can be upgraded by placing upgrade modules behind it.\n\nAs far as I am aware, this is the first mod using the v1.0.21.11 mod features. Before this update, this mod would be impossible to make.\n\nPatch notes at https://github.com/Hyperion-21/Modular-Cannon/releases/tag/v1.1.0.\n\nMade by Hyperion_21"
